# to_be_named_shooty_thingy


this is a shooty boi project loosley based on warfare 1917/1944


mechanics are to be detewrmined for now the general idea of the game is as follows:


the player is the "strategist" in that they are responsible for supporting troops as they advance towards their goal(capturing a point, blowing something up, storming a beach etc etc)

your job as a player is to:

    support with artillary

    call out enemies positions

    use various gadgets(UAV's, helicopter support) to identify where enemies are


the troops will always advance towards the position no matter what, they will report their findings as they advance
